        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Back in 2007, I ventured into the world of coding when I was modifying a Blogger background template by adding in additional functions such as background music and a chatbox function. That was when I had my first experience with coding and web development. Currently, I am a full-time Biotechnologist in a Biopharmaceutical company.</p>
        
        <p>During my free time, I've had the privilege to improve my developing skills by creating new projects and optimising them. My goal is to be a <strong>Software Developer</strong>. Coding has always been my passion.</p>
